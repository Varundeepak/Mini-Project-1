# Mini-Project-1

This is a Library Management System to keep track of records of Books, Library Members,Stock details, Who borrowed What Book when, Due Date Calculation, Automatic Fine Calculation.
This application also automatically sends a reminder message to a Member 2 days before their Due Date as a way of reminding them, and another message on the Due Date itself. 
When a new book is added to the Library Records, a message with the details of the book like Author Name, Title of The Book etc. are sent as a message to all the Members letting them know that this book is now available to them.
To avail this messaging system, you need a GSM Modem with a SIM Card to send those messages. This application was built when Jio offered free messaging services, so during the time of building this application, this messaging system was a cost-effective way of sending messages.
You can modify the values of the modem in the code and use it for yourself.
If have used a DB to store all values, so if you have your own DB, you can use your DB details to store values in it. jarconnector should be included in this application to communicate with a database.
